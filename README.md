# darwin-symposium-2025

Materials associated with IT RCI tutorial sessions presented at the 2025 DARWIN Symposium.

## B sessions

The B sessions are more-technical in nature.  Examples and commands presented are in the context of the DARWIN cluster.

### B.1:  Using Python Virtual Environments

A Python virtual environment is constructed and used to fit 1d potential energy data from a series of Gaussian calculations.  A neural network (via Keras/Tensorflow) and three traditional functional forms are compared.

### B.2:  Job Scheduling & Monitoring with Slurm

The 1d potential problem from B.1 is extended to two input dimensions at finer granularity, producing 1444 data points to calculate.  The resulting Slurm array job is followed from inception through execution.
